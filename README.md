# Fire_detection_System
Developed a real-time fire detection and emergency alert system integrating embedded hardware with a mobile application for emergency response in small commercial or residential environments.

Designed a sensor-based fire monitoring unit using Arduino Uno, MQ-2 smoke sensor, and DHT11 temperature sensor for real-time environmental monitoring.
Implemented threshold-based fire detection logic to trigger alerts upon abnormal smoke or temperature rise.
Integrated HC-05 Bluetooth communication to send fire alerts from the hardware module to an Android mobile application.

Built an Android app using MIT App Inventor capable of:
1. Receiving real-time fire alerts
2.Sending SMS with live GPS location to the owner/emergency contacts
3. Initiating direct emergency phone call for rapid assistance
